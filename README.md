Hey my name is Hugo, and this is my first Javascript program built from scratch.
As the title suggest I am going to be making a rock paper scissors game.
This program will have a UI and be a fully functional game played against a computer!
What I hope to demonstrate with this project is 
    - Basic javascript knowledge 
    - Basic CSS & HTML knowledge
